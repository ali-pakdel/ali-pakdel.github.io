## Who am I?
Iâ€™m Mohammad Taha Fakharian, an undergraduate computer engineering student living in Tehran, Iran. I first learned about programming in high school while I was getting familiar with algorithms. I developed a passion for software development as I began to write more code throughout my studies and personal projects. Since then, I have developed open-source projects which I encourage you to read more about on my GitHub page. Today, I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Tehran, focusing on neuroscience and AI applications in other fields, e.g., AI in healthcare.

## What are my research interests?
Security, Privacy, Congitive Sciences, Neuroscience, Blockchain
