## Who am I?
Hello, I'm Ali Pakdel Samadi, an undergraduate computer engineering student deeply passionate about technology and its diverse applications. My programming journey commenced in high school and has flourished throughout my higher education in Computer Engineering. My curiosity about the human brain led me to pursue a minor study at the College of Psychology and Education. Throughout my academic tenure at the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece), I've actively participated in various projects, fostering my fascination with the intersection of computer engineering and cognitive science.

Currently, as a research assistant at the [Convergent Technologies Research Center] (https://utnbic.ir/en), I'm immersed in developing an advanced platform for EEG data collection and analysis. I have a deep fascination for the intersection of the mind and technology, and I love exploring this exciting domain.

## What are my research interests?
My research pursuits are centered on cognitive sciences and their practical applications, aiming to enhance human health and overall well-being. Specifically, my primary research focus revolves around leveraging computer science and AI to gain deeper insights into life, with a keen interest in understanding the intricacies of human cognition and neural processes. This curiosity extends to diverse areas such as cognitive science, computational cognitive science, and neuroscience, all of which captivate my imagination. Brain-computer interfaces emerge as particularly intriguing, serving as pivotal instruments in transforming human-computer interaction and presenting transformative prospects in healthcare, where artificial intelligence plays an indispensable role.

## What are my other interests?
Exploring nature on short wilderness trips during holidays is something I enjoy. I'm also a fan of football and like to play it. Additionally, I have an interest in video games.
